# friends
## Simulation shows that even with friendships assigned at random, most people's friends have more friends (on average) than they do.
This fact is show with real data by Scott L. Feld in [Why Your Friends Have More Friends than You Do](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/why-your-friends-have-more-friends-than-you-do#email-newsletter).
Here we use a simulation written in C to show the same thing.
